# Project Background\n\nThe second Pazhou Algorithm Competition is an authoritative professional event in the field of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and is jointly sponsored by various organizations. Through this competition, we focus to create solutions for key industries like green energy, smart transportation, artificial intelligent manufacturing, e-commerce, and cutting edge technology.\n\nFor more details, visit the official site: [https://ai.baidu.com/tech/competition/pazhou](https://ai.baidu.com/tech/competition/pazhou)\n\n# Project Description:  Joint Multitask Training based on Wenxin Traffic Big Model\n\nIn recent years, the development of smart cars and artificial intelligence has created great development opportunities for intelligent transportation. Existing large models' multitasking processing modes and traditional perception methods (such as classification, detection, segmentation, etc.) can't satisfy our pursuit of a wider traffic scene and higher level of automatic driving. We address these issues by making a single large model possess abilities while obtaining performance leading to specific single-task models.\n\n# Honors Awarded\nThe winner of the competition has the opportunity to compete for the "Grand Prize" with prize money upgraded to 1 million.\n\nChampion: 100K + Certificate\nRunner Up: 50K + Certificate\nSecond Runner Up: 30K + Certificate\nExcellence Awards & Top 10 globally: Certificates\n\nNote: The champion team's prize money will be fully paid to the team leader, who is responsible for distributing it according to their internal agreement.\n\n # Participation Requirements and Rules\n\n**Eligibility:** Individuals and teams with no limit on age, identity, nationality, and belonging to related field research institutions, business units, higher education institutions, teams and individuals can register for the competition.\n\n**Registration Requirement:** Participants can register as individuals or as a team with a maximum of 5 members per team. Cross-unit teams are allowed, but a single individual can join only one team.\n\n**Qualification Requirement:** Participants must comply with the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, have no criminal record, and must not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights.\n\n**Submission Requirement:** Participants need to submit algorithm models and codes based on the Baidu Paddle deep learning platform.\n\nThe important competition rules to be emphasized include:\n\n1) Enhancement of training set data can be used for training.\n2) Testing data can be used for enhancement and testing.\n3) Cross-training and cross-testing between training set and testing set are not allowed (for example, pseudo-labels for testing sets are not allowed for training or semi-supervised learning).\n\nPlease register at the [AI Studio competition platform](https://ai.baidu.com/tech/competition/pazhou) for participation.
